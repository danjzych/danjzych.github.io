      <h1>A bit more about <span>me</span>!</h1>
      <p>I was born in the suburbs of Chicago, where I lived until I moved away to attend the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison in 2012.
        I graduate with a B.S. in Psychology and Philosophy in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>After graduating, I worked in a psychology research lab briefly before working in a <a href="https://abuseintervention.org" target="_blank"/>domestic abuse shelter</a> I previously volunteered at as a student.</p>
      <p>I left the shelter to work at a <a href="https://www.rentable.co/">start-up</a> my friend was working at. I worked there for four years, discovering my love of tech along the way. After working on the <a href="https://www.rentable.co/">product</a> team for four years, I left to work as a touring musician. I have recently finished touring, and am now looking forward to beginning a career as a software developer!</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I love to play and produce music, skateboard, eat good food and drink good coffee, and hang out with my partner and our kittens (Okay, fine, they are three years-old, but they're always gonna be kittens, ya know?)</p>
